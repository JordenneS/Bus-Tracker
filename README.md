# Bus-Tracker
# Description: This program is an animation. When the program is ran, pin on the map will cycle through all the bus stops on the fastest route between MIT and Harvard. 
# How To Run: After opening the program, press the 'Show stops...' button to see the route. 
# Future Improvements: In the future, I want to move the map a little closer and play around more with the style elements such as changing the pin marker to a different graphic.
